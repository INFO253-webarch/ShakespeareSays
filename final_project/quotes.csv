 Thou cream-faced loon
Thou art as loathsome as a toad
"Peace, ye fat guts"
I do desire we may be better strangers
"Thou art a flesh-monger, a fool and a coward"
Thou art as fat as butter
"Away, you three inch fool"
"You, minion, are too saucy"
Beg that thou may have leave to hang thyself
"I do not like your look, I promise thee"
"If thou art changed to aught, tis to an ass"
"You talk greasily, your lips grow foul"
Weed this wormwood from your fruitful brain
Pernicious and indubitate beggar
I wish you all joy of the worm
You speak an infinite deal of nothing
"Love all, trust a few, do wrong to none"
It is not in the stars to hold our destiny but in ourselves
"Good night, good night! Parting is such sweet sorrow, that I shall say good night till it be morrow"
"We know what we are, but know not what we may be"
Cowards die many times before their deaths; the valiant never taste of death but once
Better a witty fool than a foolish wit
"God has given you one face, and you make yourself another"
"The golden age is before us, not behind us"
"Listen to many, speak to a few"
The evil that men do lives after them; the good is oft interred with their bones
Suspicion always haunts the guilty mind
Love is a smoke made with the fume of sighs
An overflow of good converts to bad
False face must hide what the false heart doth know
What’s done can’t be undone
With mirth and laughter let old wrinkles come
Conscience doth make cowards of us all
"Some are born great, others achieve greatness"
[Thou] mad mustachio purple-hued maltworms
