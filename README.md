# ShakespeareSays

by Paul Glenn, Dina Bseiso, Sameer Bajaj and Reema Naqvi

This is the final project for the Web Architecture course at the UC Berkeley School of Information. The assignment was to incorporate a URL shortener (implemented in the part_one folder) into a larger web-based project.

We chose to be cheeky and created a "URL Lengthener" chrome extension, which generated a "long URL" from the browser's current page, drawing on a small csv of Shakespearean insults to create the url text.

To run, clone the repository and start the flask server with `python app.py` in Python 3. Then install the extension to Chrome by choosing "Load Unpacked Extension" from the Extensions menu and selecting the folder you cloned to.
